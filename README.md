# Motion-Planning-for-UAV

## Overview

This project implements path and trajectory planning for a quadrotor navigating through a pre-mapped 3D environment. It includes environment mapping, RRT* path planning, trajectory optimization, and PID control.


### Prerequisites

- Blender
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

### Installation

Instructions to set up the project environment.

## Usage

Steps to run the project:
1. Map reading and display.
2. Path planning with RRT*.
3. Trajectory generation.
4. PID control for navigation.
